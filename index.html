                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>I am a hard working, bright student hoping to aid my fellow peers in challenging subjects. I have a 3.97 (UW) 4.18 (W) GPA, and got a 94 on the geometry regents and a 98 on the chemistry regents, making me well versed in both subjects. I recently participated in two science competitions for my Foundations of Research Honors class in the spring of 2025. In my group, we were regional semi-finalists in the Junior Exploravision competition, and won High Honors in the LISC (Long Island Science Congress) competition. I have a passion for coding, being proficient in the coding languages Python, Kotlin, HTML, and CSS, and have foundational knowledge of Java, C#, and Javascript. I have exercised my knowledge of these coding languages in ways such as recreating retro games for fun, and even coding this website from scratch. </p>
